                                Globoweather is a project that I created using
                                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide users with
                                accurate and up-to-date weather information from
                                around the world. The application utilizes the
                                OpenWeather API to retrieve data for various
                                weather conditions and the Unsplash Image API to
                                display corresponding images of the location.
                                With the ability to parse through over 200,000+
                                cities, users can search for their desired
                                location and access relevant information with
